# Collections Online

Getting images, video, sound and other types of content published online, in a
way that provides:

- A simple, yet powerful, interface with free-text and structured filtering and
  sorting.
- A unique and stable URL for every piece of content.
- A high degree of freedom and possibilities to customize.
- [Features](./FEATURES.md) that can be turned on and off when configuring.

In short: Collections Online can help get your digital assets online, for
visitors to search, browse, share and contribute to. Collections Online is
(at least not for now) not a tool for uploading, maintaining or editing a
digital collection. It's more shell of web technology making the collections
more browsable, accessible and usable to the average visitor.
